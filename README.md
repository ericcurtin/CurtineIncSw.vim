# CurtineIncSw.vim
Switch from \*.c\* to \*.h\* and vice versa

## description
Some assumpions: 

  filename for header and implementation is identical excluding the directory 
    and extension (foo.c -> foo.h supported, foo.c -> bar.h not supported) 
  
  user opens files from base of repo 
  
  repo contains both implementation and header files 

Based on these assumptions, you don't need to reconfigure when you switch 
between repos, provided the headers and implementation are all in the same repo.
